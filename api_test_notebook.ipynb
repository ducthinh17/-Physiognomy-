    "\n",
    "### Common Issues and Solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **\"Response ended prematurely\"**: \n",
    "   - This usually means the server closed the connection unexpectedly\n",
    "   - Check if the server is running and accessible\n",
    "   - Try with a smaller image file\n",
    "   - Increase timeout value\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **File not found**: \n",
    "   - Make sure your image file exists at the specified path\n",
    "   - Update the `IMAGE_PATH` variable to the correct location\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **API returning JSON instead of ZIP**:\n",
    "   - Your current API returns JSON with image URLs (which is working correctly)\n",
    "   - The ZIP file code was expecting a different API format\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Server errors (500)**:\n",
    "   - Check server logs for detailed error information\n",
    "   - Ensure all required models are loaded properly\n",
    "   - Verify image format is supported (JPG/PNG)"
